# A new beginning
I've been hard at work rewriting the Lions' Den as a so-called *Progressive Web App*. You may have already come across the term. [friend.tech](https://friend.tech/) is a recent example of a PWA Dapp.

There are many advantages to building a PWA app. It is really just a web app with additional capabilities that allow your device to bundle, store, and run it locally. This means it runs on any device with a sufficiently modern browser and is comparatively extremely easy to develop and maintain - perfect for a lone lioness with a very busy day job like myself! The major disadvantage is that it does not have all capabilities of a native app, such as networking or advanced platform-specific features. Only well established standards are supported, but those are all we need, really.

It'll take me some time to rewrite the codebase, but it'll be worth it!
