# Lions' Den - Progressive Web App
This is an on-going WIP, a rewrite of the [Lions' Den React Native + Expo mobile app](github.com/kiruse/lions-den). Inspired by [friend.tech](https://friend.tech), a *Progressive Web App* is much better suited for the purposes of a web 3 dapp, as it can be used across platforms and in different browsers, including mobile wallets with integrated browsers.
